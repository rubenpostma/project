My data has the goal to show the amount of Official Development  Aid (ODA) that a country gives and receives. The visualization shows in the first instance a map where you can see the countries that give/receive ODA, the different amounts of aid received/given is shown through a gradient color scale/ When you click on one of the countries a timeline shows up, which shows the given/received ODA of various years of the selected country. Then when a year within that you can see the different sectors that received the aid, which will be visualized with a bar chart.

The problem I hope to solve with this visualization is to show in a clear way how much money is spend on developmental aid, and on what sectors it has been spend throughout the years. 

  

I will use the databases from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which works close with ODA, and the World Bank. I want to set these data in a JSON format.

A similar visualization can be found on the site of the OECD but shows only a map that only shows how much a of the aid a country receives is ODA.
